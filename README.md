This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website built using full-stack web development with ASP.NET MVC. My goal was to create an organized space that I can continuously update with current projects and new skills as I progress.

What began as an interest in Razor Pages eventually shifted toward MVC due to its clearer structure and more flexible, maintainable flow. I wanted this project to reflect how I think about software design, particularly in how code is organized, how responsibilities are separated, and how different parts of the application are logically sectioned.

This site was deployed on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and an Application Load Balancer. The cloud infrastructure is currently offline to avoid ongoing hosting costs, but the application is fully deployable and was tested in a production environment.

While I plan to improve the UI with more interactive features over time, my primary focus moving forward is on strengthening the underlying architecture, efficiency, and overall maintainability of the codebase.
